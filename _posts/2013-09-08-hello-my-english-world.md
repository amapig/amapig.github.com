As a programmer, I have always been reading english documents.But I didn't try to write something with english, now it's time to hello english world.

You may ask why I want to write English blog?

1. I want to improve my english skills, in every aspect;
2. I want to share my programming experiences to much more person around the world.

Although I'm not a top programmer, I also want to share these knowledges, since I can not find some perfect answers on the world.

Keep hungry, keep fulish.

Anyway, I just want to say I'll begin to blog in english from now on.
